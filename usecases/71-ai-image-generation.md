# 71. AI Image Generation

## Introduction

Need a custom illustration for your blog post? A product mockup for a pitch deck? A social media graphic that stands out? Instead of spending hours in Photoshop or hiring a designer, your AI agent can generate professional images in seconds using Nano Banana 2 — Google's Gemini 3.1 Flash image model.

This use case lets you create images through natural conversation. Describe what you want, and your agent handles the technical details — model selection, aspect ratios, prompt optimization. The result is delivered directly to your chat, ready to download and use.

Perfect for content creators, marketers, developers, and anyone who needs custom visuals without the design overhead.
