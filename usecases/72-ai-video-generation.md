# 72. AI Video Generation

## Introduction

Creating video content used to require cameras, editing software, and hours of production time. Now your AI agent can generate professional videos from a simple text description or a reference image — product demos, social media clips, explainer animations, or cinematic B-roll.

This use case gives you access to 37 cutting-edge video models including Sora, Kling, Veo 3, Seedance, Hailuo, and WAN. Your agent handles model selection, parameter tuning, and progress tracking. You just describe what you want, and the video appears in your chat minutes later.

Perfect for marketers, content creators, educators, and anyone who needs video content without the production overhead.
