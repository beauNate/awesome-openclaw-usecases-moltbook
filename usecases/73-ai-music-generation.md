# 73. AI Music Generation

## Introduction

Need background music for your video? A custom jingle for your podcast intro? An original song for a special occasion? Your AI agent can now compose professional-quality music in any genre or style — from lo-fi beats to epic orchestral scores, from pop songs with lyrics to ambient soundscapes.

This use case gives you access to Suno v4 through v5, the leading AI music generation models. Your agent handles the creative process — you describe the vibe, genre, and mood, and it generates complete tracks with vocals (optional), instrumentation, and production polish. The result is delivered as an MP3 file, ready to use.

Perfect for content creators, podcasters, video producers, game developers, and anyone who needs original music without hiring a composer.
